                    <p>
                        West Bengal (/bɛnˈɡɔːl/, Bengali: Poshchim Bongo, pronounced [ˈpoʃtʃim ˈbɔŋɡo] ⓘ, abbr. WB) is a
                        state in the eastern portion of India. It is situated along the Bay of Bengal, along with a
                        population of over 91 million inhabitants within an area of 88,752 km2 (34,267 sq mi) as of
                        2011. The population estimate as of 2023 is 102,552,787.[12] West Bengal is the fourth-most
                        populous and thirteenth-largest state by area in India, as well as the eighth-most populous
                        country subdivision of the world. As a part of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it
                        borders Bangladesh in the east, and Nepal and Bhutan in the north. It also borders the Indian
                        states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata, the
                        third-largest metropolis, and seventh largest city by population in India. West Bengal includes
                        the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, the Ganges delta, the Rarh region, the coastal Sundarbans
                        and the Bay of Bengal. The state's main ethnic group are the Bengalis, with the Bengali Hindus
                        forming the demographic majority.

                    <p>
                        The origin of the name Bengal (Bangla and Bongo in Bengali) is unknown. One theory suggests the
                        word derives from "Bang", the name of a Dravidian tribe that settled the region around 1000
                        BCE.[30] The Bengali word Bongo might have been derived from the ancient kingdom of Vanga (or
                        Banga). Although some early Sanskrit literature mentions the name Vanga, the region's early
                        history is obscure.[31].

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Rice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying in Bengali, "machhe bhate
                        bangali", that translates as "fish and rice make a Bengali".[202] Bengal's vast repertoire of
                        fish-based dishes includes hilsa preparations, a favourite among Bengalis. There are numerous
                        ways of cooking fish depending on its texture, size, fat content and bones.[203] Most of the
                        people also consume eggs, chicken, mutton, and shrimp. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in
                        water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas.[204] Common
                        spices found in a Bengali kitchen include cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger,
                        green chillies and turmeric.[205] Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and
                        at their social ceremonies. Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including
                        Rôshogolla, Chômchôm, Kalojam and several kinds of sondesh. Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread,
                        or dim sum, are specialties of the winter season. Sweets such as narkol-naru, til-naru, moa and
                        payesh are prepared during festivals such as Lakshmi puja.[206] Popular street foods include
                        Aloor Chop, Beguni, Kati roll, biryani, and phuchka.[207][208]
