          <h2>About <span>Meghalaya</span></h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            meghalaya is a landlocked state in the north-eastern region of India. 
            It is bordered by the Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh to the north,
            Assam to the west, Manipur to the south, and the Naga Self-Administered
            Zone of the Sagaing Region of Myanmar (Burma) to the east. Its capital city 
            is Kohima and its largest city is the twin Chümoukedima–Dimapur. The state 
            has an area of 16,579 square kilometres (6,401 sq mi) with a population of
            1,980,602 as per the 2011 Census of India, making it one of the smallest
            states of India.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            meghalaya consists of 16 Administrative Districts, inhabited by 17 major 
            tribes along with other sub-tribes. Each tribe is distinct in character
            from the other in terms of customs, language and dress. It is a land of
            folklore passed down the generations through word of mouth. The earliest
            recorded history of the tribes of present-day meghalaya dates back to the 
            13th century.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the 19th century, the British India forces began expanding their influence
            in Northeast India, including the Naga Hills. After India's independence in 1947,
            the question of the Naga Hills' political status emerged. meghalaya was a district
            in the State of Assam until 1957, known to others as “The Naga Hills”. 
            The Naga National Council, led by Zapu Phizo, demanded an independent Naga state
            and launched an armed insurgency.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
           The Indian Government, however, maintained that meghalaya was an integral part of 
           the Indian Union. The conflict between the Naga National Council and the Indian 
           Government resulted in a protracted insurgency. The State of meghalaya was formally
           inaugurated on 1 December 1963, as the 16th State of the Indian Union, and a 
           democratically elected government took office in 1964.
