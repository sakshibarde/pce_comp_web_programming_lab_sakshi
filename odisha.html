                        A must visit place in Odisha, the temple is based along the River
                        Mahanadi, and its bells made it work as a lighthouse in the past.
                        Since the river near the temple could get rough and cause boats to
                        drown, the bells in the temple alerted the boats beforehand during
                        strong winds caused by the sound of the bells.

                    <h3>Odisha- Bountiful Buddhist Sites</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Kuruma </b>:Kuruma is a Buddhist site as well as an
                        archaeological site in Odisha and is among the most popular
                        tourist places of the state. The excavations found an image of
                        Lord Buddha seated in a Bhumisparsha mudra, which is a unique one
                        in the state. The site also contains Heruka, who is a Buddhist
                        deity and has long brick walls made with ancient bricks. The
                        excavation of the site has brought forth rooms and halls which
                        were probably made for teaching and purposes of praying. Apart
                        from these, a number of coins, manuscripts, and seals have also
                        been discovered from the site at Kuruma. <br />
                        <b> Langudi</b> : After the forest of the Langudi Hill was
                        deforested in the 1950s, a number of Buddhist Stupas and sites
                        were discovered making it today one of the top places to visit in
                        Odisha. Out of the 34 stupas that were found, the big 5 among them
                        were referred to as the 'Panch Pandava' by the locals but the
                        Mahastupa remained underneath a mound which was discovered later.
                        Near the mahastupa you will find the 34 stupas, carved into the
                        rock surrounded by elaborate carvings. There are also carvings of
                        Buddha in dhyana mudras, the goddess Tara, Avalokiteshvara, and

                        destination is popular for its elephant, cut out from a rock which
                        is believed to be among the earliest rock cut sculptures in
                        Odisha! Near the elephant stands the Dhauli Stupa or the Peace
                        Pagoda of Dhauli. The dome-shaped structure has stone panels where
                        one can spot Lord Buddha's footprints and the Bodhi tree, the tree
                        under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment.
