            <h3>Kavaratti Island</h3>
            <p>
              The administrative capital, Kavaratti is the most developed of the
              islands with the highest percentage of non-islanders as residents.
              Fifty two mosques are spread out over the island, the most
              beautiful being the Ujra mosque. A well, within its precincts, is
              believed to contain water of curative powers. The Ujra mosque has
              an ornately carved ceiling, said to have been carved from a piece
              of driftwood. Kavaratti also has an aquarium with several
              colourful species of fish. There is a glass bottom boat for
              viewing marine life and an array of remarkable coral formations
              that pro- vides a background to the lagoons and the islands:
              within them. Some Water Sports like kayaking canoeing and
              snorkeling are available for tourists.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Kalpeni Island</h3>
            <p>
              Kalpeni has three uninhabited satellite islands, all surrounded by
              an immense lagoon of spectacular beauty. Sunlight on the water
              causes it to sparkle and flash like a million aquamarines. Koomel,
              the gently curving bay where the tourist facilities are located,
              directly over- looks Pitti and Thilakkm, two of the islands. Here
              you can swim, reef walk, snorkel or use water sports equipment
              like kayaks, and sail boats. Now the tourist facilities have been
              augmented and tourists can stay on the island in privately managed
              huts, depending on the package. This lagoon is specially rich in
              coral life.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Kadmath Island</h3>
            <p>
              A particularly fine lagoon, of even depth and an endless
              shoreline, perfect for swimming, makes Kadmath a haven of
              solitude. The tourist huts are situated some distance away from
              habitation, with only the splash of the waves to break the
              silence. During the day, when the heat of the overhead sun becomes
              too strong, the feathery network of coconut palms provides a
              canopy throughout the island, through which light dimly filters,
              green and cool. It is the only island with lagoons on both eastern
              and western sides. A Water Sports Institute providing water sports
              facilities has been set up in Kadmath. Accommodation consists of
              AC and non AC tourist huts aesthetically situated in the coconut
              palm groves on the beaches. The island is becoming increasingly
              popular for honeymooners. As a testimony to its Water Sports
              potential, a Scuba Diving Centre has been set up there. With the
              Water Sports Institute, Scuba Diving Centre and the proposed
              augmentation of accommodation, the island is sure to become the
              focal point of tourist activities in Lakshadweep.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Minicoy Island</h3>
            <p>
              Furthest from Kavaratti island, 200 km away to the south and also
              nearest to the Maldives, Minicoy has a lighthouse built by the
              British in 1885. Visitors are allowed up, right to the very top.
              Words cannot do justice to the incredible size of the lagoon, one
              of the largest in Lakshadweep, the green of coconut trees, and the
              mirror-like surface of an inland lake as it nestles in one corner
              of the island. Minicoy has a culture very different from any other
              island - dress, language, food, all differ. Minicoy has a cluster
              of 10 villages, which are called Athiris, each presided over by a
              Moopan. A walk through the winding lanes of the villages is an
              indication of the culture here. Minicoy is renowned for its dance
              tradition: the lava dance is performed on festive occasions. There
              is a tuna canning factory - signifying its importance in tuna
              fishing and boat building activity. Privately managed cottages
              have been built on the isolated beaches and are available for
              tourists.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Agatti Island</h3>
            <p>
              Agatti has one of the most beautiful lagoons in Lakshadweep. This
              is where the airport is built. A virtual gateway to Lakshadweep, a
              20 bed tourist complex has been set up here. The island will
              shortly be opened for tourists.
